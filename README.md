# Search-Engine

Using Java, built the front and back end of a search engine that recursively searched through websites, scraped URLs, and stored word locations in an advanced data structure called an Inverted Index. The Inverted Index uses TFIDF as the ranking algorithm to rank in a search results page. Used cookies to store search history and MySQL for user accounts.

- Built a product that parallelized multiple processes at benchmark speeds without loss in performance.
- Rigorous testing for robust code and accuracy of required matched outputs
- Required application of Java, HTML, and SQL
